# Eye
get live camera feed

### what is it ###
It's a python script that retrieves live stream from cameras on the skyline network and displays the image.

### How it works ###
It scans the skyline website for links to the cameras, then it asks the users in which country they would like to see.
Then it will obtain a live stream from a specified number of cameras in that area and display them in separate windows.

This script will become outdated if the skyline website undergoes major changes.
It was last tested on 19th March, 2019.
